# Chain API

**Initialize Client**

Import dependencies from [injective-py](https://pypi.org/project/injective-py/) and configure the gRPC client in order to send messages to the Injective Chain. You can include multiple messages in a single transaction.

```python
from pyinjective.composer import Composer as ProtoMsgComposer
from pyinjective.client import Client
from pyinjective.transaction import Transaction
from pyinjective.constant import Network
from pyinjective.wallet import PrivateKey, PublicKey, Address

async def main() -> None:
    # select network: local, testnet, mainnet
    network = Network.testnet()
    composer = ProtoMsgComposer(network=network.string())

    # initialize grpc client
    client = Client(network.grpc_endpoint, insecure=True)

    # load account
    priv_key = PrivateKey.from_hex("f9db9bf330e23cb7839039e944adef6e9df447b90b503d5b4464c90bea9022f3")
    pub_key =  priv_key.to_public_key()
    address = pub_key.to_address()
    subaccount_id = address.get_subaccount_id(index=0)
```
